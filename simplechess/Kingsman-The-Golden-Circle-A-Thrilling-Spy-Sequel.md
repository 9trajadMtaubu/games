The film opens with Eggsy, A.K.A. Galahad (Taron Egerton) stepping out of the Kingsman tailor shop on Saville Row in London. He is approached by former Kingsman recruit gone rogue Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft). He holds a gun at Eggsy and forces him into a Kingsman taxi cab while Charlie's accomplices are close behind them. As they are riding away, Eggsy and Charlie begin to fight. [^3^]
 
Eggsy manages to escape from Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's cybernetic arm, severed in the skirmish, hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer in Eggsy's car. With the information gained, Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle, launches missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and kill all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong), Kingsman's tech support. [^2^]
 
Eggsy and Merlin follow an emergency protocol that leads them to a secret vault under a liquor store in Kentucky. There they discover that Kingsman has an American counterpart called Statesman, posing as a bourbon whiskey distillery. They are greeted by Agent Tequila (Channing Tatum), who takes them to Statesman's headquarters. There they meet Statesman's leader, Agent Champagne (Jeff Bridges), tech support Ginger Ale (Halle Berry), and Agent Whiskey (Pedro Pascal). They also learn that Harry Hart (Colin Firth), Eggsy's mentor and former Galahad who was shot in the head by Valentine in the first film, is alive but suffering from amnesia. [^2^]
 
Meanwhile, Poppy broadcasts a message to the world, revealing that she has laced all recreational drugs with a toxin that causes users to develop blue rashes before progressing through mania, paralysis, and ultimately death. She offers an antidote to the world if the President of the United States ends his country's war on drugs and grants her cartel immunity from prosecution. The President publicly agrees to Poppy's terms but secretly plans to let all drug users die while keeping some of the antidote for himself and his inner circle. [^2^]
